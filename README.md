# Poker_Plus_Project
A coding project for my James Scholar Spring '22 semester.
This is my first ever coding project so I am fairly new to 
C++ and using GitHub on my own but I am sure that will change 
in the near future. This is a partially fleshed out version
or rather attempt at coding Poker. There is no full gameplay as of 
now but what my code can do is deal cards and determine hands.
